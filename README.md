# Circuit-Analyzer
This repository contains a solo coding project i made for college it takes a circuit description consisting of resistors as an input and outputs it's equivalent resistance

The format of the circuit description(input):

1- Series connection: s 2 2 e

Where the last example describes a circuit that looks like this:<br><br>
![Diagram](Images/s22e.png)

if we calculate the equivalent resistance of this example it will equal 4.

2- Parallel connection: p 2 2 e

Where the last example describes a circuit that looks like this:<br><br>
![Diagram](Images/p22e.png)

if we calculate the equivalent resistance of this example it will equal 1.

3- Then we can combine both examples to have a slightly more complicated circuit with the circuit desription being: s22p22ee

For a circuit that looks like this:<br><br>
![Diagram](Images/s22p22ee.png)

having an equivalent resistance of 5.

And here is the output of the code on all of the previous examples:<br><br>

And you can test the code yourself with countless more possibilities.
